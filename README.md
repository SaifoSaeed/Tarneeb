## 📖 Overview

Tarneeb (Arabic: طرنيب, literally "trump") is a four-player game where players divided into two teams compete to win "tricks." The game is defined by its bidding phase and the strategic use of the trump suit.

### Key Features
* **Bidding System:** Accurate implementation of the 7–13 bidding cycle.
* **Team Dynamics:** Partners sit opposite each other to reach the score goal (usually 31 or 41).
* **AI/Local Play:** Exclusively dedicated for the single-player experience.
